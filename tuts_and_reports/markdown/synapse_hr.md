## Introduction
This document shows the results from two programs that simulates the fast synapse between two Hindmarsh-Rose neurons.

## Parameters
The parameters choosed are based on the file *"pract3-15.pdf"* inside the directory **`resources/`**.

The values $S_{fast}=0.44$, $V_{fast}=-1.66$, $E_{syn}=-1.92$ for Hindmarsh-Rose synapses, are obtained from **Table 2**.

The **Table 3** of the document shows the values of maximal conductance, and we can see that *LP* neuron and *PY* neuron have a both values between them. 
So neuron1 will be *LP* and neuron2 *PY*, being $gfast_{1}=0.241$ and $gfast_{2}=0.186$.

The rest of the values ($time increment$, $x_{initial}$, $e$, $m$ and $S$) for the model, are the same used on the part 2 of the same document.
