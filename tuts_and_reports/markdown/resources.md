## Real-Time Operating Systems

### Linux with PREEMPT_RT
A version of Linux configured for real-time applications by applying the PREEMPT_RT. Widely used in research labs due to its open-source nature and flexibility.

### Xenomai
A real-time development framework that works alongside the Linux kernel, providing hard real-time capabilities with low latencies.

### RTLinux
An older approach to achieving real-time performance with Linux. While less common today than PREEMPT_RT or Xenomai, it laid the groundwork for many modern real-time Linux implementations.

### QNX
A commercial RTOS known for its reliability in embedded and safety-critical applications. Its microkernel architecture offers robust real-time performance.

### VxWorks
Another commercial RTOS often used in embedded systems. It provides deterministic execution times, making it suitable for applications where timing is critical.

## Real-Time Tools for Neuron Experiments
### RTXI (Real-Time eXperiment Interface)
An open-source platform designed specifically for real-time, closed-loop experiments in neuroscience. RTXI has been widely adopted for dynamic clamp experiments, where real-time feedback is essential.

### NeuroRighter
An open-source system for real-time neural interfacing. It supports closed-loop stimulation and recording, making it a useful tool for experiments requiring precise timing control.

### Open Ephys
A community-driven project that offers both hardware and software solutions for real-time electrophysiology. Its open-source nature and modular design have made it popular among experimental neuroscientists.

### MATLAB/Simulink Real-Time
Although more general-purpose, MATLAB/Simulinkâ€™s real-time capabilities are often used to design, simulate, and deploy closed-loop experimental protocols, including dynamic clamp and real-time signal processing for neural experiments.

### Dedicated Dynamic Clamp Systems
There are various hardware/software combinations developed in research labs that implement dynamic clamp techniques. These systems often leverage RTOS (like those mentioned above) to ensure the precise timing needed to simulate ionic currents in neurons.
